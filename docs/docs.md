## 📌 Best Practices for Documentation

-   Keep content **up-to-date** with code changes.
-   Use **consistent formatting** (Markdown headers, code blocks, lists).
-   Include **diagrams and examples** when helpful.
-   Make docs **easy to navigate** with clear links and structure.
-   Review documentation as part of **code reviews**.

The goal of the `docs/` folder is to be a single source of truth for development, setup, architecture, and maintenance. Proper documentation ensures that new contributors can onboard quickly and existing contributors can understand the system efficiently.
